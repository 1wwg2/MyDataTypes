# MyADT Library

**MyADT** (My Abstract Data Types) is a collection of C++ implementations of classic data structures. This library is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to explore how common data structures work under the hood.

## 📦 Features

This library includes:

- ✅ Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
- ✅ Binary Tree
- ✅ Stack and Queue
- ✅ Vector
- ✅ Hash Table
- ✅ Unique and Shared Smart Pointers (custom implementation)

Each data structure is implemented using modern C++ features, such as smart pointers.
